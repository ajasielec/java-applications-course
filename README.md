Java projects developed during my 'Programming Window and Mobile Applications' course.
## lab 1: 2D and 3D figure calculator
This program allows the user to choose one of three geometric shapes (triangle, square, circle) and input the relevant dimensions, such as sides or radius, with data validation for correctness. The program also displays the calculated properties of the shape (perimeter and area) in a graphical user interface (GUI) and optionally converts the shape to a 3D version.
